# FlashDeck
FlashDeck is a personalized study tool that mimics old school flashcards built for the modern age using the MEN stack. 

As an emerging engineer, a pen and paper simply hasnâ€™t kept up with the many concepts and terms I learn each day. Creating my own study tool has provided a solution to managing my ever-growing concept/term bank. FlashDeck has also put my new coding skills into practice developing a practical, scaleable app that can adapt and grow to support learners of all types.
